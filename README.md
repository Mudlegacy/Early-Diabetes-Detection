# Predictive Modeling for Early Diabetes Detection


<!-- This is a generic banner, you can create a custom one! -->

## üìñ Overview

This project, completed by **Team DataVerse**, focuses on the early detection of diabetes. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, we performed comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and feature engineering to build a robust classification model. Our final model, a tuned **Random Forest Classifier**, successfully predicts whether a person has diabetes with an **accuracy of 79%** and a strong **AUC score of 0.84**, prioritizing the correct identification of diabetic patients (high recall).

## üéØ Problem Statement

A mobile health clinic aims to pre-screen patients for diabetes using basic health indicators. The goal is to reduce hospital crowding and focus medical resources on at-risk individuals. This project addresses the problem by:
1.  Using EDA to uncover the factors that most significantly influence the risk of diabetes.
2.  Developing a reliable classification model to predict a patient's diabetes status based on attributes like BMI, Glucose levels, and age.

## üíæ Dataset

The project utilizes the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, a classic dataset for binary classification problems in healthcare.

*   **Source:** Originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, widely available on platforms like Kaggle.
*   **Description:** The dataset contains 768 patient records with 9 columns. The target variable, `Outcome`, is binary (1 for diabetic, 0 for non-diabetic).
*   **Key Features:** `Pregnancies`, `Glucose`, `BloodPressure`, `SkinThickness`, `BMI`, `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`, and `Age`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Pipeline

Our approach to solving this problem followed a structured pipeline:

1.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
    *   **Missing Value Imputation:** Identified that key features like `Glucose`, `BMI`, and `BloodPressure` had `0` values, which are physiologically impossible. These were treated as missing data and imputed using the **median** value of each column to ensure robustness against outliers.
    *   **Outlier Handling:** Applied **Winsorization** to cap extreme values in key features, preventing them from skewing the model.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    *   Analyzed feature distributions and found the dataset was **imbalanced**, with significantly more non-diabetic patients than diabetic ones.
    *   Confirmed through correlation heatmaps and boxplots that **Glucose** is the most significant predictor of diabetes.
    *   Identified moderate correlations between the outcome and `BMI` and `Age`.

3.  **Feature Engineering & Selection:**
    *   Created a new categorical feature, `Insulin_Category` (Low, Medium, High), to better capture the impact of insulin levels on diabetes.
    *   Used **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** to identify the most impactful features for the model.

4.  **Modeling & Evaluation:**
    *   **Initial Modeling:** Trained and compared three different models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Used `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal parameters for the top-performing models (Random Forest and Logistic Regression).
    *   **Addressing Class Imbalance:** To improve the model's ability to identify diabetic patients (class 1), we trained a Random Forest model with `class_weight="balanced"`.
    *   **Threshold Tuning:** Further refined the balanced model by adjusting the prediction threshold to **0.45**, which increased the **recall for the diabetic class to 80%**. This is critical for minimizing false negatives in a medical context.

## ‚ú® Results & Findings

*   **Final Model:** The **Balanced Random Forest Classifier** with an adjusted threshold was selected as the final model.
*   **Performance:**
    *   **Accuracy:** 76% (on the threshold-adjusted model)
    *   **AUC Score:** 0.84
    *   **Recall (Class 1 - Diabetic):** **80%** ‚Äî Our model correctly identifies 80% of all diabetic patients.
*   **Key Feature Importance:** `Glucose`, `BMI`, and `Age` were consistently identified as the most important features for prediction.
